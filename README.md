_Keep practicing **jquery** - **Multiple Branching**: (if', else if', else') statements_,<br/>

_version: 23/04/2019_<br/>
_By **Josh Hortt**_

## Description
_Insurance companies generally charge more to men under 26. I added EUR 50 to the quote for this aspect_.<br/>
_I added a certain amount for Seniors (both), when they are over 65 years of age_.<br/>
_For females I added certain rules regarding age and the region where they live_.<br/>
_The Web-page asks the **User** to enter **age**, **gender**, and **region** where the User lives_.<br/>
_After inputs when a User clicks the **calculate** button, it calculates the monthly amount the User_<br/>
_have to pay. Depending certain age, gender and region requirements the User get a quote (result)_.<br/>
_If they leave the age field blank the User get an **alert** asking them to enter their age_.<br/>
_Further development will be implemented_.
